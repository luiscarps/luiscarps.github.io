### CPSC 120 

* Lab 11 

    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because it taught me how to utilize constructors in code. By using member functions, I was able to call and initialize values to use in the hilo game. It was nice to see the hilo game evolve over time.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because I like how we were able to create a pattern using code. By incrementing and decrementing certain values and putting a symbol in its place, we made a pattern in the terminal. I imagine we can incorporate this code in other programs to create patterns as well. 

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because calculating the price per square inch of pizza is something that can apply to real life. By inputting the diameter and price of the pizza, we were able to calculate the price per square inch, giving the customer the option to see which pizza was the best bang for their buck.
